## Hey👋🏻, I'm Mucahit Bilal, a Computational Design Technologist living in Turkey.

With background in architecture, I am passionate about computational design and BIM. Currently, I am working at **[Kalyon Co.](https://kalyonholding.com/Home)** as a Computational Design Specialist, working across multiple projects doing a lot of automation for tedious tasks. I am specialised in the use of BIM and its implementation in a wide variety of project scales and types. I have a high level of understanding in **Python🐍, Dynamo and Grasshopper🦗**. 

I envision a connected, progressive and collaborative AEC Industry. I have a strong level of ability to organize activities, work with team members and increase the motivation of team. I am open to learn, extend, and improve the individual capabilities and communication skills. I love learning new things, tools and softwares in my spare time.
