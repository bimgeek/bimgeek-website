Above are list of softwares that I am most confident about. Other than that:

- I know **Adobe Photoshop** and **Illustrator**. My **Photoshop** skills are better than **Illustrator** ones though.
- I have tried to pass my processes to open source.
- I have tried **Blender** but decided it is not suitable (yet) for architectural design (at least for me😅).
- I also tried **Unreal Engine 4** for visualization purposes but it was sucking the energy⚡ out of my laptop💻, so i sticked with the solutions I currently use which are **Enscape** and **Twinmotion**.

## Achievements 🥇

### Honorable Mention [@eVolo Skyscraper Competition 2019](https://www.evolo.us/arbor-tower/)

April 2019

Arbor Tower project have been awarded with Honorable Mention at eVolo Skyscraper Competition 2019. You can see the project details on the link above.☝🏻

### 3rd Place @Design Together with BIM

April 2018

Project includes the design of a social center to be used by students at Ayazaga Campus. Main point of this competition was designing a building with other disciplines involved in a BIM process.

## Community and Volunteer Experience 🤝

---

Much of what I have learned is from the people around me 👨‍👨‍👦. For this reason, if I want to improve💪🏻 myself in a field, I surround myself with people who are interested🤔 in that subject. It's also really nice to be with people you speak🗣️ the same language with.

<img src="images/bim4turkey-logo.png" width=300px>

[BIM4TURKEY](https://bim4turkey.com/en) is a platform belonging to “Building Information Modeling and Management Association”. It aims to facilitate the integration of Building Information Modelling and Management (BIM) easier and smoother to the building industry, higher education and public companies.

We have founded it to create an atmosphere around the subject of BIM. Now, it has turned into an umbrella organization☂ rather than a platform. All the major construction companies (such as TURNER, Kalyon (my current company), BSI and many more) have partnered with us in achieving our mission💪🏻.

<img src="images/codeist-logo.png" width=300px>

`CO.DE:IST` is a community of Computational Design enthusiasts in Istanbul. Our reason for establishing this community was to learn from each other and increase the knowledge in our country.

We get together every two weeks and each week has its topic. That week's speaker presents his work to the community. Presentation topics can be a solution brought by the speakers in their workflow processes via **Dynamo**, **Grasshopper** or **Revit API**. We have learned a lot from each other since this community was formed.

<img src="images/osarch-logo.png" width=300px>

The **Open-Source Architecture Community** brings together like-minded users and developers who share a common goal: that the built environment can be designed, constructed, operated, and recycled with free/libre and open-source software, with increased transparency, and a more ethical approach.

I have been involved with the OSArch community for about **a year** now. I have been creating **graphic designs🖼** for meetups and operating the **[OSArch Youtube Channel🔴.](https://www.youtube.com/c/OSArchOrg/videos)**
