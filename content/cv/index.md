## Summary ‚úç
---

I am an architect with experience in a wide variety of project scales and types, worked with designers, engineers and contractors in all phases of building design and construction. I leverage BIM, VDC and Design Technology to provide impactful tools for project success. My current focus is on design automation and leveraging data in BIM models for meaningful results.

## Community and Volunteer Experience ü§ù

---

Much of what I have learned is from the people around me üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüë¶. For this reason, if I want to improveüí™üèª myself in a field, I surround myself with people who are interestedü§î in the same subject. It‚Äôs also really nice to be with people you speak the same language with.

### BIM4TURKEY
*Board Member*

*[BIM4TURKEY](https://bim4turkey.com/en)* is a platform belonging to ‚ÄúBuilding Information Modeling and Management Association‚Äù. It aims to facilitate the integration of Building Information Modelling and Management (BIM) easier and smoother to the building industry, higher education and public companies.

We have founded it to create an atmosphere around the subject of BIM. Now, it has turned into an umbrella organization‚òÇ rather than a platform. All the major construction companies (such as TURNER, Kalyon (my current company), BSI and many more) have partnered with us in achieving our missionüí™üèª.

### SPECKLE
*Contributor*

*[Speckle](https://speckle.systems)* is a cloud based solution for the AEC industry that provides interoperability, real time collaboration, data management, versioning and automation. I am a firm believer in this project and try to contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting new features and creating tutorials that showcases how to use Speckle in our workflows.

### CO.DE:IST

**`CO.DE:IST`** is a community of Computational Design enthusiasts in Istanbul. Our reason for establishing this community was to learn from each other and increase the knowledge in our country. We get together every two weeks and each week has its topic. That week‚Äôs speaker presents his work to the community. Presentation topics can be a solution brought by the speakers in their workflow processes via Dynamo, Grasshopper or Revit API. We have learned a lot from each other since this community was formed.

### OSArch Community

The **Open-Source Architecture Community** brings together like-minded users and developers who share a common goal: that the built environment can be designed, constructed, operated, and recycled with free/libre and open-source software, with increased transparency, and a more ethical approach.

I have been involved with the OSArch community for about **a year** now. I have been creating **graphic designsüñº** for meetups and operating the **[OSArch Youtube Channelüî¥.](https://www.youtube.com/c/OSArchOrg/videos)**
