Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹,

I created a tutorial on placing objects randomly on a topography using Grasshopper inside Revit and created a forest model as an example case. The treeðŸŒ³ family I've used is actually created by [Gavin Crump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAklXEEB8FH1KuvQVCe5FpXAGFX0kN7ncdw). I gave him credit in the video as wellðŸ˜Š. Please comment the topics you would like to see more content about. This tutorial is a great example to show how integrated Grasshopper and Revit are.
