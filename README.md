This repository contains all the base files of [bimgeek website](https://bimgeek.github.io). It is created using Hugo static site generator and PaperMod theme.  Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator (SSG) written in Go. There are other SSGs but I chose hugo because:

- It is open-source and it is really fast. Haven't tried it myself but what I see is it is faster than Jekyll (built in Github pages ssg.)
- It is really easy to use. I learned Hugo in a day and created this website in about a week. I used Markdown for most of the contents. (other than buttons, video links etc.)
- It supports multi-language site creation. I think I will add Turkish language in the future.

You can learn more about hugo [here](https://gohugo.io)ðŸ‘ˆ.

PaperMod is a minimal, fast, and clean hugo theme. It's got great documentation detailing a lot of information.
